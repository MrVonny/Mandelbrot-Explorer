# Mandelbrot Explorer

This program is written using WPF C# to explore the Mandelbrot Set. 

## What is Mandelbrot Set?

If you are here, then most likely you know what it is. If you do not know, then I strongly recommend that you read Wikipedia and a couple more sites:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set
- https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MandelbrotSet.html

## How to use the program?

I hope you read something about how the calculations go. First you need to choose the coordinates that can be found on the Internet. By the way, there are a lot of beautiful coordinates here http://www.cuug.ab.ca/dewara/mandelbrot/images.html.
Then choose the number of iterations, after which the cycle is interrupted. The main thing to know is that the closer you approach the set, the more iterations you need to set, otherwise you will get a black picture. For example, for a 2 x 2 image 100 iterations are enough, but for a image ![alt text](https://bit.ly/2JKKtkY) x ![alt text](https://bit.ly/2JKKtkY) you need 2000 iterations.
